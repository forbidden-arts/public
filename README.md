This is a collection of applets that I am writing/have written to deal with
common tasks related to the Python Challenge and the Euler Project.

Most of them are related to data handling, data manipulation, or CPU 
intensive math questions.

***EDIT***
A *lot* of this is ending up being projects from CS50. Adding them here for
future reference.
